Complex Systems under Shock Mechanisms

The stochastic model of complex systems based on Bernoulli shocks and Poisson shocks is studied in both continuous and discrete time, and the system reliability index is statistically inferred.


Consecutive-k-out-of-n Systems under Shock Environments

Consecutive-k-out-of-n systems with periodic shocks and imperfect repairs are analyzed, and their reliability indicators are statistically inferred.
