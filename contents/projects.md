### <span class="fs-5 fw-semibold text-primary mb-1">Complex Systems under Shock Mechanisms</span>
The stochastic model of complex systems based on Bernoulli shocks and Poisson shocks is studied in both continuous and discrete time, and the system reliability index is statistically inferred.

### <span class="fs-5 fw-semibold text-primary mb-1">Consecutive-k-out-of-n Systems under Shock Environments</span>
Consecutive-k-out-of-n systems with periodic shocks and imperfect repairs are analyzed, and their reliability indicators are statistically inferred.
